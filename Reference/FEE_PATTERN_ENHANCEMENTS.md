# Fee Pattern Enhancements

## Overview

This document describes the enhancements made to the dollar amount pattern matching in the RDN Fee Scraper application. These enhancements focus on improving the extraction of fee amounts from text by handling variable spacing after the dollar sign ($) symbol.

## Problem Identified

The original pattern matching used `\$\s*` which technically allows any number of spaces after the $ symbol. However, in practice, this was causing issues with the extraction of some fee amounts due to unpredictable spacing patterns. By limiting the spaces to a maximum of 3, we achieved more reliable and predictable extraction.

## Enhancements Made

### 1. Dollar Amount Pattern Updates

#### Python Regex Patterns

| Pattern | Before | After | Description |
|---------|--------|-------|-------------|
| `money_regex` | `r'\$\s*([0-9,]+(?:\.\d{1,2})?)'` | `r'\$\s{0,3}([0-9,]+(?:\.\d{1,2})?)'` | Matches dollar amounts with 0-3 spaces after $ |
| `basic_dollar_regex` | `r'\$\s*(\d+)'` | `r'\$\s{0,3}(\d+)'` | Matches simple whole number amounts with 0-3 spaces after $ |

#### JavaScript Regex Patterns

| Pattern | Before | After | Description |
|---------|--------|-------|-------------|
| `amountRegex` | `"\\$\\s*([0-9,]+(\\.[0-9]{2})?)"` | `"\\$\\s{0,3}([0-9,]+(\\.[0-9]{2})?)"` | Matches dollar amounts with 0-3 spaces after $ |
| `dollarAmountRegex` | `"\\$\\s*([0-9,]+(\\.[0-9]{2})?)"` | `"\\$\\s{0,3}([0-9,]+(\\.[0-9]{2})?)"` | Matches dollar amounts with 0-3 spaces after $ |

### 2. Specialized Pattern Matching

Added support for specific fee patterns commonly found in RDN update entries:

```python
# Pattern for "fee request is for X in the amount of $Y"
fee_request_regex = re.compile(r'fee\s+request\s+is\s+for\s+(.*?)\s+in\s+the\s+amount\s+of\s+\$\s{0,3}([0-9,.]+)', re.IGNORECASE)

# Pattern for "storage fee of $X"
storage_fee_regex = re.compile(r'storage\s+fee\s+of\s+\$\s{0,3}([0-9,.]+)', re.IGNORECASE)
```

### 3. Context-Aware Fee Type Detection

Added improved detection of fee categories based on surrounding text:

```python
# Common fee category keywords
fee_categories = {
    'field visit': ['field visit', 'field fee'],
    'flatbed': ['flatbed', 'flat bed'],
    'dolly': ['dolly fee', 'dolly service'],
    'mileage': ['mileage', 'fuel', 'gas'],
    'incentive': ['incentive', 'bonus'],
    'keys': ['key', 'keys'],
    'storage': ['storage', 'store', 'holding'],
    'towing': ['tow', 'towing'],
    'repossession': ['repo', 'repossession', 'recovery']
}
```

## Files Created

1. `server-with-space-fix.py` - The main server file with the enhanced dollar amount patterns
2. `test_spacing_patterns.py` - Script to test basic pattern matching with various spacing
3. `comprehensive_fee_test.py` - Script to test full fee extraction logic with context awareness

## Testing Results

The enhanced patterns were tested against various text examples, including:

- Fees with no space after $ (`$123.45`)
- Fees with single space after $ (`$ 123.45`)
- Fees with two spaces after $ (`$  123.45`)
- Fees with three spaces after $ (`$   123.45`)
- Multiple fees with different spacing patterns in the same text
- Fees with comma in the amount (`$1,234.56`)
- Fees using specific formats like "fee request is for X in the amount of $Y"
- Fees using formats like "storage fee of $X per day"

All tests passed successfully, demonstrating that the enhanced patterns correctly handle the various spacing patterns and fee formats found in the RDN update entries.

## Confidence & Method Information

The fee extraction now includes confidence scores and method information:

- `fee_request_pattern`: High confidence (0.95) extraction using specific fee request pattern
- `storage_fee_pattern`: High confidence (0.90) extraction using storage fee pattern
- `keyword_detection`: Medium-high confidence (0.80) extraction using keyword context
- `general_money_pattern`: Medium confidence (0.60) extraction using basic dollar pattern

## How to Use

Run the enhanced server with:

```bash
python server-with-space-fix.py
```

This will use the improved dollar amount pattern matching with spacing limits to more accurately extract fees from the RDN updates.

## Future Improvements

Potential areas for further enhancement:

1. Add more specialized patterns for other fee formats
2. Improve confidence scoring with machine learning approach
3. Add support for fee ranges (e.g., "$100-150")
4. Enhance fee type categorization with more contextual keywords
5. Support for percentage-based fees (e.g., "10% of $500")
