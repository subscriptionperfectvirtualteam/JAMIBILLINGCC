# Fee Extractor Improvements

This document describes the improvements made to the fee extraction functionality in the RDN Fee Scraper application to handle variable spacing after dollar signs.

## Overview

The original fee extraction functionality had issues with detecting dollar amounts that had spaces after the dollar sign symbol. This improvement enhances the regex patterns to correctly handle various spacing scenarios, as required.

## Improved Patterns

The following improvements were made:

1. Enhanced dollar amount detection with improved regex patterns
2. Added support for up to 3 spaces after the $ symbol
3. Created specialized patterns for different fee mention formats
4. Implemented corresponding JavaScript patterns for browser-side extraction

## Key Regex Patterns

The key regex patterns introduced include:

```python
# Main money regex pattern with improved spacing handling
MONEY_REGEX = re.compile(r'\$\s{0,3}([0-9,]+(?:\.\d{1,2})?)')  # Allow 0-3 spaces after $ and single decimal place

# More specific patterns for common fee mentions
AMOUNT_OF_REGEX = re.compile(r'amount\s+of\s+\$\s{0,3}([0-9,.]+)', re.IGNORECASE)
FEE_DOLLAR_REGEX = re.compile(r'fee\s+\$\s{0,3}([0-9,.]+)', re.IGNORECASE)
```

## JavaScript Implementation

The improvements also include JavaScript-side extraction code with equivalent patterns:

```javascript
// Pattern for "amount of $X" with up to 3 spaces after $
const amountOfRegex = /amount\s+of\s+\$\s{0,3}([0-9,.]+)/i;

// Pattern for "fee $X" with up to 3 spaces after $
const feeAmountRegex = /fee\s+\$\s{0,3}([0-9,.]+)/i;

// Any dollar amount with up to 3 spaces after $
const moneyRegex = /\$\s{0,3}([0-9,]+(?:\.\d{1,2})?)/i;
```

## Files Created

1. `fee_extraction_improved.py` - Contains the improved regex patterns and extraction functions
2. `fee_extractor_integration.py` - Script to integrate the improvements into the server-upgradedv2.py file
3. `test_fee_extraction.py` - Test script to validate the improved extraction patterns

## How to Use

### Testing the Improvements

You can run the test script to verify that the new patterns correctly handle spaces:

```bash
python3 test_fee_extraction.py
```

### Integrating the Improvements

To integrate the improved extraction into the main server file:

```bash
python3 fee_extractor_integration.py --server-file server-upgradedv2.py
```

Or to create a new file with the improvements:

```bash
python3 fee_extractor_integration.py --server-file server-upgradedv2.py --output-file server-upgradedv3.py
```

## Test Cases

The implementation has been tested with the following formats:

- Standard: `$250.00`
- One space: `$ 150.00`
- Two spaces: `$  125.50`
- Three spaces: `$   300.00`
- No space between text and $: `is$100.00`
- Comma formatting: `$ 1,234.56`
- Mixed formats in a single text

All test cases pass successfully.

## Integration Notes

When integrating with the server-upgradedv2.py file, the following changes are made:

1. Replace the basic money regex pattern definitions
2. Update the approved_regex pattern to handle spaces
3. Add the new specific patterns for amount_of and fee_dollar
4. Add additional extraction code in the update scanning section

These changes ensure that no dollar amount is missed regardless of spacing after the $ symbol.
