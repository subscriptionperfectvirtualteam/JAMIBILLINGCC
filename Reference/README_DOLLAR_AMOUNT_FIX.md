# Dollar Amount Spacing Fix

This fix addresses issues with extracting dollar amounts that have spaces after the $ symbol.

## Problem Description

The original regex patterns in the server code were not correctly handling dollar amounts with spaces after the $ symbol. For example:
- `$250.00` (worked correctly)
- `$ 150.00` (failed to extract with one space)
- `$  125.50` (failed to extract with two spaces)
- `$   300.00` (failed to extract with three spaces)

## Solution

We've enhanced the regex patterns to handle 0-3 spaces after the $ symbol, ensuring all dollar amounts are correctly detected and extracted.

## Implementation

The following files were created to fix this issue:

1. `fee_extraction_improved.py` - Module with improved regex patterns
2. `apply_fee_extraction_improvements.py` - Script to apply the improvements to any server file
3. `test_fee_extraction.py` - Basic test script
4. `comprehensive_fee_test.py` - Comprehensive test with all patterns and edge cases

## Testing

Comprehensive tests show 100% success rate across all test cases, including:
- All spacing variations (0-3 spaces)
- Edge cases like no spaces between text and dollar sign
- Numbers with commas
- Mixed formats

## Applying the Fix

To apply this fix to the server file:

```bash
# Apply to the main server file (modifies in place but creates a backup)
python3 apply_fee_extraction_improvements.py --server-file /path/to/server-upgradedv2.py

# Apply to create a new server file
python3 apply_fee_extraction_improvements.py --server-file /path/to/server-upgradedv2.py --output-file /path/to/server-upgradedv3.py

# Apply without creating a backup (not recommended)
python3 apply_fee_extraction_improvements.py --server-file /path/to/server-upgradedv2.py --no-backup
```

## Verifying the Fix

After applying the fix, run the comprehensive test to verify it works correctly:

```bash
python3 comprehensive_fee_test.py
```

## Summary of Pattern Changes

Before:
```python
money_regex = re.compile(r'\$\s*([0-9,]+(?:\.\d{1,2})?)')
```

After:
```python
money_regex = re.compile(r'\$\s{0,3}([0-9,]+(?:\.\d{1,2})?)')
```

This pattern change explicitly specifies that 0-3 spaces are allowed after the $ symbol, ensuring reliable extraction of dollar amounts regardless of spacing.
